This is a framework for having a client/server project, while using typescript, and having shared files.
Hopefully just running npm install is enough to make it work. Otherwise do install, but with the --save-dev flag.

To start the client, run: "npx parcel src/client/index.html"
To start the server, run: "npx tsx watch src/server/server.ts"

It should auto update when the side, or the shared side changes. Although if you change the client, the server does not refresh.
The http server is hosted seperately on "parcel" but it works and I am not touching it.
